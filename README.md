**Stage of Light - Six Customized Videos** is a Unity project designed for NTNU Art Museum. It enables the projection of 6 customized videos onto the respective walls and floors of the immersive projection space, "Stage of Light." This space utilizes a Windows-based dome projection system that integrates with **Resolume Arena** to display the Unity project's build folder seamlessly.

- **Customizable Content:** Easily replace demo content with your own panoramic videos.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity Editor **2021.3.6f1** or later is required (2021.3.6f1 is recommended).

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hsuehyt/StageOfLight6CustomizedVideos
   ```
2. Extract the zip file (if downloaded) and add the project to Unity Hub.
3. Open the project in Unity.

### Opening the Scene
1. Navigate to `Assets/StageOfLight/`.
2. Open the scene named **`6CustomizedVideos`**.
3. Click **Play** to test the scene.

---

## Adding Your Video

1. Import your videos into `Assets/StageOfLight/`.
2. In the **Hierarchy** panel, select `VideoPlayers`.
3. In the **Inspector** panel, under `VideoPlayers > Video Clip`, replace the demo videos by dragging the videos into the respective slot.
4. Test the videos by playing the scene.

## Video Format and Recommendations

### Suggested Format
- **Resolution:** 4K (4096x2048). For immersive/VR experiences, use **8K**, but note that Unity's Video Player currently supports up to **4K**.
- **Aspect Ratio:** Maintain a **2:1 aspect ratio** (width to height) for panoramic videos.

### Encoding with Adobe Media Encoder
- **Preset:** `H.264 > Match Source - Adaptive Low Bitrate`
- For better quality, use `Match Source - Adaptive High Bitrate`.

⚠ **Note:** High bitrate can cause playback issues for longer videos due to increased file sizes.

### Projection Mapping
Panoramic videos should use the **equirectangular format**, commonly used for VR 360 content:
- **Sources:**  
  - 360 cameras (for live-action footage)  
  - Rendering from 3D tools like **Maya**, **Blender**, or **Unity**  
  - AI-generated content (e.g., text-to-360, image-to-360, image-to-video)

### Room Shape Considerations
- Due to the **eccentric shape of "Stage of Light"**, which deviates from an ideal straight cube or dome shape, parts of the image may be **cut or distorted during projection**.  
- To minimize image loss, ensure **careful alignment and testing**.
